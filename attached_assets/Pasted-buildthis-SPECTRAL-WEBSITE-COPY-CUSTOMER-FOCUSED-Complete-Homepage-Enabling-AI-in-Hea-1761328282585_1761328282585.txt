Finally, Governance for Healthcare AI



Your board asks: "Are we compliant across all our AI?"

Tomorrow, you can say: "Yes. Here's proof."



One platform to see, monitor, and prove compliance across every AI vendor—

from Epic and OpenAI to imaging vendors and internal tools.

5 health systems deployed  |  240+ AI models verified  |  2-3 weeks to deployment

Your AI Problem Right Now



You're deploying AI faster than you can govern it.



You probably have:

• Epic AI built into your EHR

• 3-5 imaging AI vendors (radiology, pathology)

• Documentation tools (ambient scribes, clinical notes)

• Internal productivity platforms

• Point solutions you forgot about



Your CISO can't answer basic questions:

❌ "What AI do we have deployed?"

❌ "Is it HIPAA compliant?"

❌ "Are we monitoring for PHI leakage?"

❌ "Can we prove this to auditors?"



Your procurement team is stuck:

❌ Evaluating vendor #8 with the same 120 questions

❌ Waiting 6 months per security review

❌ No standardized process

❌ Every vendor evaluation starts from scratch



Your board is asking questions you can't answer.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━



Who Built This



Founded by people who've lived this problem:



• Former health system CISOs who built AI governance from scratch

• FDA and compliance experts who wrote the regulations

• AI engineers from leading AI companies



We're the only team with all three perspectives.



That's why Spectral works in the real world, not just in theory.





═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════



For Health Systems



Q: What if we only have 3 AI vendors right now?



A: Perfect. Start with Foundation ($75K/year).

   As you adopt more AI, upgrade to Growth or Enterprise.

   Most health systems add 5-10 AI vendors per year.



━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━



Q: How is this different from Qualified Health?



A: Qualified Health is an AI platform for internal productivity.

   Spectral is governance infrastructure for ALL your AI.

   

   You can use both:

   • Qualified Health for employee chat/productivity

   • Spectral to govern QH + Epic + imaging + everything

   

   We're complementary, not competitive.



━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━



Q: Can't we just build this ourselves?



A: You could. But most health systems don't because:

   

   • Costs $15M+ and 3-5 years in engineering

   • Need to hire specialized healthcare + AI + compliance engineers

   • Regulations change quarterly (constant maintenance)

   • Your mission is patient care, not building governance software

   

   We've built it. We maintain it. You focus on patients.



━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━



Q: Does this replace our compliance team?



A: No. It augments them.

   

   Your team does: Strategic decisions, policy, board communication

   Spectral does: Daily monitoring, evidence generation, automation

   

   Your team becomes more strategic, less reactive.



━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━



For AI Vendors



Q: How is this different from SOC 2 or HITRUST?



A: Those certify your company's security.

   Spectral certifies your AI model's behavior.

   

   Health systems want both:

   • SOC 2: "Is your company secure?"

   • Spectral: "Is your AI safe for clinical use?"

   

   Complementary. Not a replacement.



━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━



Q: What if we fail verification?



A: Results are private until you share them.

   

   Gap report shows exactly what to fix:

   • P1: Critical issues (PHI leakage, bias)

   • P2: Compliance gaps

   • P3: Best practices

   

   Most vendors iterate 1-2 times before going public.

   We help you succeed.



━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━



Q: Do health systems actually accept this?



A: Yes. 5 committed, 15+ in pilots.

   

   As more adopt (like SOC 2), it becomes expected.

   Early vendors get competitive advantage.



━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━



Q: What happens when our model updates?



A: Quarterly re-verification included (all plans).

   

   Certified and Trusted tiers get continuous monitoring:

   • Detects model changes automatically

   • Alerts if new risks introduced

   • Streamlined re-test (not full re-audit)

   

   Badge stays current as your AI evolves.



━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━



General



Q: How often do regulations change?



A: Constantly. New rules every 3-6 months:

   • State AI laws (CA, CO, NYC)

   • NIST AI RMF updates

   • FDA guidance changes

   • HIPAA interpretations

   

   Spectral tracks all of this automatically.

   You stay compliant without manual monitoring.



━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━



Q: Are you affiliated with any AI vendor or health system?



A: No. Completely independent.

   

   We don't sell AI. We don't favor anyone.

   Pure verification service.

   

   That's why both sides trust us.

KEY DIFFERENCES FROM PREVIOUS VERSION:



REMOVED (too strategic/internal):

✗ All "4-layer architecture" explanations

✗ "Layer 3 translation engine as moat" exposition

✗ "$150B coordination failure" market sizing

✗ "We only had to build Layer 3" capital efficiency talk

✗ Deep competitive analysis of why others can't replicate

✗ Exposition on "open infrastructure" as strategic choice



KEPT (just enough differentiation):

✓ "Independent" (1 sentence - explains neutrality)

✓ "Works with any vendor" (key differentiator from closed platforms)

✓ "Not affiliated" (builds trust)

✓ Brief mention of Qualified Health (positions against alternative)



ADDED (customer-focused):

✓ Their specific pain points (board questions, procurement delays)

✓ What they get (see everything, monitor, prove compliance)

✓ Real customer quotes (anonymized but specific)

✓ Concrete examples (100-bed hospital, 2-person startup)

✓ Simple ROI calculations (their math, not market sizing)



TONE:

• Empathetic to their pain

• Direct about the solution

• Minimal jargon

• Results-focused

• Easy to scan
