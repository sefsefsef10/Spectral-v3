# SPECTRAL - COMPLETE COMPANY DESCRIPTION
**Definitive Reference Document**
*Use this to explain Spectral to anyone - investors, customers, partners, or AI*

Last Updated: January 2025

## **ELEVATOR PITCH (30 seconds)**

Spectral is the independent verification infrastructure for healthcare AI. We help health systems govern their entire AI portfolio (Epic, imaging vendors, internal tools‚Äîeverything) and help AI vendors get certified once to close deals everywhere. Think SOC 2, but for healthcare AI-specific risks like PHI leakage, clinical accuracy, and bias.

---

## **THE PROBLEM WE SOLVE**

### **For Health Systems (Buyers)**

Healthcare organizations are deploying AI faster than they can govern it:

- **23 AI systems on average** across Epic, imaging vendors, documentation tools, productivity platforms, RCM systems
- **CISOs can't answer basic questions:** "What AI do we have? Is it HIPAA compliant? Are we monitoring for safety?"
- **Procurement is frozen:** Each vendor takes 6-12 months to evaluate (120-question security reviews, manual testing, legal review)
- **Board is asking questions:** Executives need proof of AI compliance but have no unified visibility
- **Building internal capability is expensive:** $15M+ and 3-5 years to build governance infrastructure from scratch

**Current Reality:** AI adoption is frozen because health systems can't govern what they can't see, and evaluating every vendor independently takes too long.

---

### **For AI Vendors (Sellers)**

AI companies selling into healthcare face brutal procurement cycles:

- **6-12 month security reviews** for every health system customer
- **Same 120 questions** answered repeatedly (HIPAA, PHI handling, bias testing, clinical validation)
- **Deals die in procurement** even after clinical champions love the product
- **No standardized process** means starting from zero with each customer
- **Sales cycles kill runway** especially for early-stage companies

**Current Reality:** Healthcare procurement is so slow that promising AI companies run out of money before closing enough deals.

---

## **THE ROOT CAUSE: COORDINATION FAILURE**

This is a **$150 billion coordination failure:**

- 6,000 hospitals √ó 50 AI vendors = **300,000 duplicate evaluations**
- Each evaluation: 6-12 months + $500K in staff time
- **Everyone evaluates everyone independently** because there's no trusted third party

Healthcare needs what other industries have:
- **Software:** SOC 2 auditors (verify once, trust everywhere)
- **Payments:** PCI compliance (standardized certification)
- **Manufacturing:** UL certification (independent safety testing)

**Healthcare AI has no equivalent. Spectral is building it.**

---

## **HOW SPECTRAL WORKS**

### **For Health Systems: Unified Governance Platform**

One platform to govern your entire AI portfolio‚Äîregardless of vendor.

#### **ü™ê Constellation - Portfolio Governance**
- **See everything:** Complete inventory of every AI system (Epic, imaging vendors, internal tools)
- **Unified oversight:** One dashboard showing all deployments, risk levels, compliance status
- **Executive reporting:** Board-ready summaries of AI portfolio health
- **Policy enforcement:** Apply governance policies across all vendors simultaneously

**Example:** 500-bed hospital discovered 23 AI deployments (expected 8). Now governed centrally.

---

#### **üõ°Ô∏è Sentinel - Real-Time Safety Monitoring**
- **24/7 monitoring:** PHI leakage detection, model drift alerts, bias monitoring, hallucination detection
- **Automated response:** Rollback systems on critical failures (PHI exposure, safety issues)
- **Intelligent alerts:** Prioritized by severity, no alert fatigue
- **Works everywhere:** Monitors Epic, third-party vendors, internal tools simultaneously

**Example:** PHI pattern detected in model output. System rolled back automatically in 2 minutes. Breach prevented.

---

#### **üìä Watchtower - Compliance Automation**

### **Market Position**
- **First mover** in independent healthcare AI verification
- **No direct competitors** (Qualified Health is closed platform, not verification)
- **Network effects starting:** Early health systems becoming "Spectral Standard" adopters

---

## **COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE**

### **Not Competitors (Different Categories):**

**Closed AI Platforms** (e.g., Qualified Health, Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare)
- They **provide AI tools** for productivity
- We **verify any AI tool** regardless of provider
- **Complementary:** Health systems use both (Qualified Health for chat + Spectral to govern QH + Epic + imaging vendors + everything)

**Horizontal AI Monitoring Tools** (e.g., LangSmith, Arize, Weights & Biases)
- They **monitor AI performance** (latency, accuracy, drift)
- We **translate AI metrics to healthcare GRC** (HIPAA controls, FDA requirements)
- **We integrate them:** Spectral uses LangSmith/Arize as data sources, adds healthcare translation layer

**Traditional GRC Platforms** (e.g., OneTrust, ServiceNow)
- They **manage general IT compliance** (SOC 2, ISO 27001)
- We **specialize in AI-specific risks** for healthcare (PHI in AI, model bias, clinical accuracy)
- **Different use case:** GRC platforms don't understand AI telemetry or healthcare workflows

---

### **Potential Future Competitors:**

**If Horizontal Tools Enter Healthcare:**
- LangSmith, Arize could add healthcare compliance features
- **Our moat:** 3+ years encoding healthcare expertise, existing network effects, regulatory relationships
- **Why they won't:** Healthcare is high-liability, they'd get sued if wrong, not core business

**If Closed Platforms Open Up:**
- Qualified Health could try to become verification layer
- **Our moat:** Conflict of interest (can't fairly judge competitors), not independent
- **Why they won't:** Verification commoditizes their platform advantage

**If Health Systems Build Internal:**
- Large systems could build DIY governance
- **Our moat:** $15M+ and 3-5 years to replicate, regulations change quarterly, not core competency
- **Why they won't:** Not their mission (patient care), too expensive, can't share across systems

---

## **THE TECHNOLOGY**

### **What We Actually Built (Product Architecture)**

**Frontend:**
- **Health System Portal:** Dashboard, inventory, monitoring, reporting, vendor directory
- **Vendor Portal:** Certification tracking, analytics, Trust Page management
- **Public Trust Pages:** Vendor verification status (like SOC 2 reports)

**Backend:**
- **Integration Layer:** Connects to LangSmith, Arize, Epic APIs, vendor APIs, monitoring tools
- **Translation Engine:** üîí **THIS IS THE MOAT** - Converts AI telemetry ‚Üí Healthcare GRC controls
- **Compliance Engine:** Maps events to HIPAA, NIST AI RMF, FDA guidance, state laws
- **Alerting System:** Real-time monitoring, intelligent thresholds, automated responses

**Data Infrastructure:**
- **Telemetry Ingestion:** Collects AI usage data, model outputs, performance metrics
- **Risk Scoring:** Calculates risk levels based on clinical use case, PHI exposure, drift
- **Evidence Generation:** Automated audit trails, compliance documentation

---

### **The Translation Engine (Our Defensible IP)**

**The Problem It Solves:**

LangSmith shows: "Model latency increased 15% over 7 days"

But CISOs need to know:
- Which HIPAA control is violated?
- What NIST AI RMF requirement is affected?
- Is this reportable to FDA?
- What action is required per our governance policy?

**Our Translation Layer:**

```
LangSmith Alert: "Model latency increased 15%"
         ‚Üì
Spectral Translation Engine
         ‚Üì
‚ö†Ô∏è NIST AI RMF MANAGE 4.1: Performance degradation detected
‚ö†Ô∏è HIPAA ¬ß164.312(b): Service availability concern
üìã Action Required: Execute R18 rollback protocol
üìß Escalate: Governance committee within 24 hours
```

**This is 3 years of expertise encoded as software:**
- 43 HIPAA controls mapped
- 18 NIST AI RMF controls mapped
- FDA AI/ML guidance encoded
- State laws (CA, CO, NYC) incorporated
- Clinical risk frameworks integrated
- Updated quarterly as regulations change

**Why No One Else Can Build This:**
- Requires **healthcare + AI + compliance expertise** (rare combination)
- Takes **3-5 years** to encode properly
- High **liability if wrong** (breach risk)
- Needs **continuous maintenance** (regulations change quarterly)

---

## **STRATEGIC POSITIONING**

### **Our Core Insight: The Open vs Closed Choice**

Healthcare is choosing between two paths for AI:

**Path 1: Closed Platforms** (e.g., Qualified Health)
- ‚ùå Vendor lock-in (stuck with one provider)
- ‚ùå Only covers internal use (can't govern Epic AI, imaging vendors)
- ‚ùå Miss best-in-class AI (forced to use platform's models)
- ‚úì Easy decision (one vendor "handles everything")

**Path 2: Open Infrastructure** (Spectral)
- ‚úì Use any vendor (OpenAI, Epic, imaging, everything)
- ‚úì No lock-in (switch anytime)
- ‚úì Best-in-class AI (choose best tool for each use case)
- ‚úì Portable trust ("verify once, use everywhere")
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires governance layer (that's Spectral)

**History shows open wins:**
- Internet beat CompuServe
- Web beat AOL
- Android vs closed mobile ecosystems
- Cloud vs proprietary on-premise

**Closed wins early (easier to sell). Open wins long-term (innovation, flexibility, network effects).**

**Spectral is the open infrastructure for healthcare AI.**

---

## **REGULATORY LANDSCAPE**

### **Why Now? Regulatory Tailwinds**

**Federal:**
- **FDA AI/ML Action Plan:** Requires post-market monitoring for AI medical devices
- **NIST AI RMF:** Framework for AI risk management (health systems adopting)
- **HHS HIPAA Guidance:** New rules about AI and PHI handling (2024 updates)
- **CMS Reimbursement:** Starting to cover AI-assisted care (drives adoption)

**State:**
- **California SB1047:** AI safety requirements (disclosure, risk assessments)
- **Colorado AI Act:** Consumer protection, bias testing
- **NYC Local Law 144:** Bias audits for automated decision systems
- **10+ more states** considering AI legislation in 2025

**Industry:**
- **Joint Commission:** Adding AI governance to hospital accreditation standards
- **HIMSS Stage 7:** Updated to include AI governance maturity
- **Liability Insurance:** Underwriters requiring AI risk management documentation

**Translation: Health systems MUST have AI governance. Spectral provides it.**

---

## **KEY RISKS & MITIGATION**

### **Risk 1: Regulations Don't Materialize**
**Mitigation:** Already happening (FDA, NIST, state laws). Health systems need governance regardless.

### **Risk 2: Health Systems Build Internal**
**Mitigation:** Too expensive ($15M+), not core competency, can't share across systems. We already have 3-year head start.

### **Risk 3: Horizontal Tools Add Healthcare**
**Mitigation:** High liability, not core business, we integrate them (better partnership than competition).

### **Risk 4: Closed Platforms Win**
**Mitigation:** History shows open infrastructure wins long-term. Plus, can't govern Epic + external vendors with closed platform.

### **Risk 5: Slow Enterprise Sales**
**Mitigation:** Product-led growth with vendors (faster sales cycle), network effects accelerate health system adoption.

### **Risk 6: Epic/Microsoft Build Competing Product**
**Mitigation:** They're ideal acquirers. If they build, we're already ahead with network effects. More likely they acquire us.

---

## **SUCCESS METRICS**

### **North Star Metric: Network Density**

**Formula:** (# Health Systems) √ó (# Vendors) √ó (Verification Acceptance Rate)

**Current:** 5 √ó 240 √ó 0.6 = 720 "trust connections"

**Goal (18 months):** 50 √ó 300 √ó 0.8 = 12,000 "trust connections"

**Why This Matters:**
- Higher density = stronger network effects
- More connections = harder to displace
- Measures both sides of marketplace

---

### **Key Performance Indicators**

**Health System Side:**
- ARR from health systems
- Number of AI systems governed per customer
- Time to first value (days to deploy)
- Net Revenue Retention (expansion within accounts)

**Vendor Side:**
- Number of certified vendors
- Verification acceptance rate (% of health systems recognizing badge)
- Sales cycle reduction (before vs after certification)
- Vendor NPS (likelihood to recommend)

**Network Effects:**
- Vendor directory traffic
- Inbound vendor requests ("how do I get certified?")
- Health systems requiring Spectral in RFPs
- "Spectral Verified" mentions in sales materials

---

## **THE VISION (3-5 Years)**

## **HOW TO EXPLAIN SPECTRAL TO...**

### **...A 5-Year-Old**

"Hospitals use robot helpers to take care of sick people. Spectral makes sure the robot helpers are safe and don't make mistakes."

### **...Your Mom**

"You know how restaurants need health inspectors to make sure food is safe? Spectral does that for AI in hospitals‚Äîwe check that the technology is safe before doctors use it with patients."

### **...A Healthcare CIO**

"We're the independent verification layer for your AI portfolio. One platform to see, monitor, and prove compliance across Epic, imaging vendors, documentation tools‚Äîeverything. Think SOC 2 auditors, but for healthcare AI-specific risks like PHI leakage and clinical accuracy."

### **...An AI Vendor CEO**

"Get Spectral Verified once, close deals everywhere. We're the third-party certification that health systems are starting to require‚Äîlike SOC 2, but for healthcare AI. Cuts your sales cycle from 9 months to 3 weeks."

### **...A VC**

"We're building the trust infrastructure for healthcare AI‚Äîa two-sided marketplace connecting health systems (buyers) and AI vendors (sellers) through independent verification. Network effects, first-mover advantage, regulatory tailwinds, clear path to $100M ARR and strategic acquisition in 18-24 months. We're raising $2.6M to hit $5M ARR and prove the network effects are real."

### **...An Acquirer (Epic, Microsoft, Philips)**

"Spectral is becoming the standard for AI verification in healthcare. 50 health systems require it in RFPs, 300 vendors are certified. If you don't own this infrastructure, you're locked out of shaping the AI governance layer‚Äîand whoever controls verification controls market access. This is a strategic asset you need to own, not compete with."

## **FINAL SUMMARY**

Spectral is solving a **$150 billion coordination failure** in healthcare AI governance.

Health systems need to govern AI but evaluating every vendor independently takes too long (6-12 months per vendor). AI vendors need to sell to healthcare but proving compliance repeatedly kills their sales cycles.

We're building the **independent verification infrastructure** that fixes this‚Äîlike SOC 2 auditors for healthcare AI. Health systems govern their entire AI portfolio through our platform. AI vendors get certified once and close deals everywhere.

**Network effects are kicking in:** More health systems accept our verification ‚Üí More vendors get certified ‚Üí Badge becomes standard ‚Üí More health systems require it.

**Regulatory timing is perfect:** FDA, NIST, and state laws are forcing AI governance just as adoption is exploding.

**Path to exit:** 18-month playbook to become the standard, then strategic acquisition by Epic, Microsoft, or Philips at $300-500M valuation.

**This is infrastructure-level opportunity.** Whoever owns the verification layer controls market access‚Äîand we're building it first.
